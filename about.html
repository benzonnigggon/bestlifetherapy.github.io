                        <p>Hi,<br> I am David Parker. I am a qualified counselling psychotherapist, life coach and a registered social worker based in Manor Lakes, West Melbourne. With more than nine years’ experience in a range of human service sector and
                            mental health settings, I am fuelled by passion to empower individuals by developing unique ways of understanding how we think, what we feel and why we behave as we do.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am committed to facilitating desired change in youths, women and adults by helping them identify their inner strengths and resilience. I believe everyone deserves to live a happy, meaningful and fulfilling life, and achieve holistic
                            well-being. I offer a safe, supportive and non-judgemental space to explore your emotions, feelings, thoughts and actions. I tailor an individual support and care approach specific to the presented issues and needs. I enjoy
                            supporting people through life transitions, personal/professional transformations, spiritual growth and helping people develop their sense of meaning and purpose in life.</p>
                        <p>My personal style is warm, engaging and collaborative with individuals to strengthen the relationship with oneself and the world. I take a holistic and integrative approach to enhance your psychological, emotional , physical and
                            social wellbeing and assist the process of self-discovery and healing.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-6 ">
                    <div class="about-content " data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">

                            If you are wondering if I will be the right therapist for you, contact me now to book for a free 15-minute consultation.
                        </strong>
                        </p>
                        <h5 style="font-weight:500 ; ">Therapeutic Approach: </h5>
                        <p data-aos="fade-left " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                            I believe true therapy draws upon a person’s own inner wisdom and assists them in becoming more deeply connected to themselves and the world around them. I use a collaborative and supportive approach to invite individuals to identify and explore the barriers
                            to living a meaningful, purposeful and fulfilling life. The barriers may include unhelpful thoughts, patterns and belief systems, difficult emotions and unresolved issues from past life experiences. My approach is designed
                            to empower people through increased insight and understanding. I aim to provide opportunities to develop alternative ways of coping and relating to themselves and the world. I emphasize on strengthening the relationship with
                            oneself, as self-love is integral to well-being. It will assist in developing resilience, skills and tools to respond and recover from negative self-limiting beliefs, self-sabotaging tendencies and address challenges of life
                            more positively.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                            As a social worker, my practice is guided by Self-Determination, Trauma Informed, Strengths Based Approach, Social Justice and Feminist frameworks. As a psychotherapist, I am trained in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Psychodynamic
                            Therapy, and Solution-Focused Therapy.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                            And as a mindful practitioner, I am committed to working with you to cultivate peace, awareness, clarity, mindful presence and non-judgemental attitude. I involve breathing methods, guided imagery, simple mind exercises and other practices to relax the
                            body and mind and help reduce stress.
                        </p>
                        <p data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                            I favour an integrative approach which centres around the overall wellbeing of mind, body and spirit connection. I trust everyone has the ability to rise from fear, hopelessness and challenges and has power to heal, evolve and transform their life with
                            right kind of support, care and guidance. I believe in you.

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I am guided by core values of humanity, self-love, compassion, growth, courage, freedom, empowerment, education, positivity and service to others (which became core values for my own private practice work). My dream to become a private practitioner suddenly
                        became larger than just the dream. I found a purpose and meaning which motivated me into taking actions.
                    </p>

                    <div class="features  " data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                        <p>My values helped me understand how much I love to help people live an empowered life, facilitate healing in whatever way I can, support and advocate people who are vulnerable, and how much I enjoy to see the growth, courage and
                            freedom in people to live the life they desire, and how much I value education itself to spread the awareness and changes we want to see in the world. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="features  " data-aos="fade-up " data-aos-delay="50 ">
                        <h4>And that is why and how I am committed to do the work I do.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I want to help people realise their self-worth and ability to grow through difficult circumstances.</li>
                            <li>I love to help people explore and express difficult emotions and achieve emotional intelligence and well-being.</li>
                            <li>I enjoy supporting people with tools and techniques to manage stress, depression and anxiety.</li>
                            <li>I relish the experience working with people to explore their strengths and assist them in becoming the best version of themselves.</li>
                            <li>My greatest satisfaction comes from empowering women who feels lost, stuck and hopeless through self-love, compassion and self-care strategies.</li>
